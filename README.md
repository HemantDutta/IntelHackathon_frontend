# Facial Recognition Based Attendance System

# INSPIRATION FOR THE PROJECT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218500470-ec078b99-0a50-4b06-a2df-c09e47ecc187.png)
Facial recognition is a technology that has become increasingly popular due to technological advancement, with applications in passport offices, airports, police stations, ATMs/banks, and organizations. It is used to detect fraud and prevent data misuse, and is also used in web applications, social networking websites, and smartphones. Its role is to verify a human identity and prevent fraud. Face recognition is a biometric recognition technique. Biometric recognition is an information system that allows the identification of a person based on some of its main physiological and behavioral characteristics. Face recognition is a broad problem of identifying or verifying people in photographs and videos, a process comprised of detection, alignment, feature extraction, and a recognition task It has 4 steps which are :

1. Face Detection
2. Data Gathering
3. Data Comparison
4. Face Recognition

# ABOUT THE PROJECT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218503394-b52dfcc9-0620-4f44-94f5-46a09a5cc970.png)
This is a `python-based`application which provides an involuntary attendance marking system that operates without human intervention. It intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

The system can also be used to maintain track of employees or students or other instructional activities where attendance is critical. In order to be recognised, students or employees must also register in the database. The user-friendly interface allows for on-the-spot registration. Using an admin account and password, the organization's admin can email the attendance of the day to the respective email address. Only the organization's administrators will have access to the attendance information, and no changes will be made to the attendance details.

It aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

# How I built it ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218502434-f6e66043-0db0-4f85-b7f4-f33b2d33df1f.png)

### ✅ First I Import libraries

### ✅ Understand the data

### ✅ Create a Correlation and visualize it

### ✅ Test Different Models and find the best model out of it

### ✅ Train the model using Intel oneDAL to get better results and faster computation(Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL))

### ✅Save the model

✅Building application using intel oneDAL:The Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.

✅Building a facial recognition system that records the attendance of the particular by verifying it from the database. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including:

✅ Facial Points : I likely gained a deeper understanding of all the facial points which are important for one to get a distinct feature among all. I got to know that this model use 128 points on face to store facial information.

✅ Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to verify the face and make confirmation for management.

✅ Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including  crop yield data and soil data, to train our machine learning models.

✅ Fraud Detection : I likely gained insight into the trend of frauds trying to defeat the system and get the attendance marked. But as this model used to check with this high accuracy that can be avoided to a large extent.

✅ Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as knowledge of facial features, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a facial recognition system is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and machine learning knowledge.
